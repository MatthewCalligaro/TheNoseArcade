# Neural Network Information

## Models
* **vanilla_model.pkl**: The most basic version of the model, taken directly from fast.ai's lesson3-head-pose.ipynb
* **test_model.h5**: A poorly trained model, used mostly for testing integration
* **one_trained_layer.h5**: A model with the following architecture: MobileNetV2, global average pooling, fully connected layer
* **two_layer.h5**: A model with the following architecture: MobileNetV2, global average pooling, two fully connected layers
* **two_layer_200.h5**: A model with the following architecture: MobileNetV2, global average pooling, two fully connected layers trained on a larger subset of the BIWI Kinect Headpose Dataset
* **unfrozen_200.h5**: A model with the following architecture: MobileNetV2, global average pooling, two fully connected layers trained on a larger subset of the BIWI Kinect Headpose Dataset with the MobileNet layers unfrozen
* **kaggle.h5** Network trained on the Kaggle dataset to recognize nose position, requires OpenCV cascade classifier to run with the webcam
* **eye_mouth.h5** Metwork trained on the Kaggle dataset to recognize eye and mouth position, requires OpenCV cascade classifier to run with the webcam
