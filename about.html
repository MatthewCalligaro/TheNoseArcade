        <p>
          In the past decade, video games have become a major part of modern culture and have grown to appeal to an increasingly diverse audience.  Unfortunately, most games require fine motor movements in the hand and wrist to operate a controller, mouse, or keyboard.  We seek to allow a wider variety of users to play video games by creating a face-based controller and a corresponding series of games.

          Previous research suggests that tracking the nose could be used to simulate a computer mouse (<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-27872-3_32">Gireeshkumar, 2012</a>).  We took this approach one step further by creating a custom controller specifically designed to emulate the types of inputs needed to play a video game, such as button presses and joystick movement.  Our web application demonstrates the validity of this controller with three custom games that can be played entirely with face movement. This movement is tracked using a machine learning model that analyzes frames captured from the user's webcam.
