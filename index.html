    <p>
      Use your nose to guide a flying turtle as he chases his dreams. <br>
      (This <a href="playTurtleChase/custom/index.html">alternate version</a> integrates our custom model, but our model doesn't work quite well enough to render the game playable.)

    <h2>Connect Four (coming soon)</h2>
    <p>
      Follow your nose to a four in a row.

    <h2>Face Racer</h2>
